  <h2><i>Cloud 9</i></h2>
  <p>
    Salesforce was founded in 1999, and was one of the world’s first cloud computing companies. They quickly grew in popularity thanks to the simplicity and speed at which you could setup the Salesforce platform.

While other software companies at the time required you to host the software on servers ‘on premise’, Salesforce led the charge with off-premise, or in other words, ‘cloud computing’.

Salesforce has launched many product lines over the last 18 years (here’s the complete list), but their most popular products are:

<ul>
