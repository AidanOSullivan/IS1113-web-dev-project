        <p><strong>Cloud Summary:</strong>cloud computing is taking services ("cloud services") and moving them outside an organizations firewall on shared systems. Applications and services are accessed via the Web, instead of your hard drive. In cloud computing, the services are delivered and used over the Internet and are paid for by cloud customer (your business)  -- typically on an "as-needed, pay-per-use" business model. The cloud infrastructure is maintained by the cloud provider, not the individual cloud customer.</p>
